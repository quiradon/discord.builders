## ⚠️ Commercial use

Although the `website/` project is licensed under the permissive MIT License, it depends on the `components-sdk/` package, which is **licensed under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**. 

This means that while the website code itself allows for commercial use, any distribution or deployment that includes or relies on `components-sdk/` is subject to the more restrictive non-commercial terms. 

As a result, you **cannot use, deploy, or distribute the website for commercial purposes** unless you remove the dependency on `components-sdk/` or obtain a separate commercial license for it. Please review the license terms carefully before using this repository in a commercial context.
